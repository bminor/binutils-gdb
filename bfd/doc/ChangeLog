	* Makefile.in: Delete all references to seclet.c, since it's just
	been deleted.  Don't mention hash.c, linker.c, or genlink.h yet,
	since they don't contain documentation yet (hint, hint!).

Fri Nov  5 10:58:53 1993  David J. Mackenzie  (djm@thepub.cygnus.com)

	* bfd.texinfo: Small cleanups.

Tue Aug 10 14:22:39 1993  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cambridge.cygnus.com)

	* bfd.texinfo (BFD back end): Don't include elfcode.texi, since
	it's empty now and that triggers a makeinfo bug.

Mon Aug  9 16:27:30 1993  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cambridge.cygnus.com)

	* bfd.texinfo (BFD back end): New section on ELF, includes

Wed May 12 14:45:14 1993  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (CC_FOR_BUILD): New variable, define to be $(CC).
	(chew.o, $(MKDOC)): Build using CC_FOR_BUILD rather than CC, since
	it must run on the build machine.

Tue Apr  6 22:38:10 1993  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (chew):  Don't compile from .c to executable in a
	single step; it puts a temporary .o filename into the executable,
	which makes multi-stage comparisons fail.  Compile chew.c to
	chew.o, and link that, which makes identical executables every time.

Wed Mar 24 17:26:29 1993  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at poseidon.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: fix typo (bfd.texinfo not bfd.texino)

Fri Mar 19 01:13:00 1993  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@kr-pc.cygnus.com)

	* bfd.texinfo: Since BFD version number has been bumped, do same
	to "version number" on title page, and elsewhere.  Should be
	fixed to extract real version number.

Tue Mar 16 12:15:13 1993  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Add *clean rules.

	Cleanup:  Replace all uses of EXFUN in the BFD sources, with PARAMS.

Mon May 11 18:55:59 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	portable source code.  Its type could be int or void function.

Fri Apr 10 22:34:52 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Tue Dec 10 22:11:05 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	  the MKDOC macro transition.

	odd directories

Tue Dec 10 04:07:25 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)
