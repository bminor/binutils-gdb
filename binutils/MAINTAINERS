		========= Binutils Maintainers =========

This is the list of individuals responsible for maintenance and update
of the "binutils" module, which includes the bfd, binutils, include,
gas, gprof, ld, and opcodes subdirectories.  The home page for binutils
is http://sourceware.cygnus.com/binutils/ and patches should be sent to
binutils@sourceware.cygnus.com with "[patch]" as part of the subject.

		    --------- Maintainers ---------

Maintainers are individuals who are responsible for, and have permission
to check in changes in, certain subsets of the code.  Note that
maintainers still need approval to check in changes outside of the
immediate domain that they maintain.

If there is no maintainer for a given domain then the responsibility
falls to the head maintainer (above).  If there are several maintainers
for a given domain then responsibility falls to the first maintainer.
The first maintainer is free to devolve that responsibility among the
other maintainers.

	       --------- Write After Approval ---------

Individuals with "write after approval" have the ability to check in
changes, but they must get approval for each change from someone in
one of the above lists (blanket write or maintainers).

[It's a huge list, folks.  You know who you are.  If you have the
 *ability* to do binutils checkins, you're in this group.  Just remember
 to get approval before checking anything in.]
