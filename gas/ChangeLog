	m68851 choice.  Set control_regs.
	(md_parse_option): Handle "68060".
	* configure.in: Setting cpu_type, recognize m68060 too.

	* config/obj-coff.c (fixup_segment) [!BFD_ASSEMBLER]

	aligned correctly.

Fri May 27 10:05:53 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cygnus.com)

	Merged in changes from gas-2.3 net release:

	* Makefile.in (VERSION): Updated to cygnus-2.3.1.

	* config/obj-vms.c: Replaced unchecked uses of malloc with
	xmalloc.

	* listing.c (list_symbol_table): Only test BFD64, not

	* config/obj-vms.h (DBG_S_C_SQUAD, DBG_S_C_UQUAD): define these
	new VMS symbol-type macros; signed and unsigned quadword integers,
	for `long long' support.  Their values come from the existing
	DSC$K_DTYPE_QU and DSC$K_DTYPE_Q macros in <descrip.h>.  The
	VMS debugger now recognizes `long long' variables correctly.
	config/obj-vms.c (VMS_typedef_parse) [case 'r']: add entries
	for gcc2's predefined types "long double" (same as double, as
	per gcc's current state), "long long int", "long long unsigned
	int", and final `otherwise' case (to avoid uninitialized type
	and size fields).  [caveat:  predefined types "complex int",
	"complex float", "complex double", and "complex long double" are
	still missing.]

	* config/ho-vms.h (EXIT_FAILURE): define as 0x10000002 instead

	allocating new symbol entry and linking it to VMS_Symbol_type_list.

	Tue May 17 20:47:31 1994  Pat Rankin  (rankin@eql.caltech.edu)

	* config/obj-vms.c (Write_VMS_MHD_Records): don't try to interpret
	the contents of the GAS_VERSION string when falling back to it for
	language processor identification.

	* vmsconf.sh: In generated file, get ".obj" suffix right, build
	source files from other directories into objects in the current
	directory, and specify PSECT attributes explicitly to linker.
	Also added missing label.
	* Makefile.in (stamp-mk.com): Reference new variable
	VMS_OTHER_OBJS for list of non-local object files, instead of
	listing them here.

	* config/obj-elf.c (elf_frob_file): Delete elf_tc_symbol and
	elf_tc_make_sections stuff.  It was there to support PA braindamage
	which has been fixed, and in the case of elf_tc_make_sections is
	redundant with elf_tc_final_processing.

Wed Apr  6 20:48:30 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* config/tc-sparc.c (s_reserve): If section passed isn't bss,
	don't spew remainder of input file in error message.
	(tc_gen_reloc): If bfd_reloc_type_lookup returns null, print error
	message with reloc type and try to process remainder of file.

	* doc/Makefile.in (install-info-as, install-info-gasp): New
	targets, now explicitly checking $(srcdir) for info files.
	(install-info): Depend on both of them; do nothing more.

Mon Apr  4 17:06:04 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-ppc.c (ppc_insert_operand): Check PPC_OPERAND_SIGNED
	flag rather than signedp field.  Only permit extended range if
	PPC_OPERAND_SIGNOPT flag is set and assembling in 32 bit mode.
	Based on patch from David Edelsohn (edelsohn@npac.syr.edu).

	* config/tc-ppc.c (ppc_size): New static variable.
	(ppc_arch): Check for PPC_OPCODE_PPC before PPC_OPCODE_POWER.

	* config/obj-coff.h (SEPARATE_STAB_SECTIONS): Always define.

Mon Mar 28 12:35:00 1994  David Edelsohn  (edelsohn@npac.syr.edu)

	* config/tc-ppc.c (md_parse_option): Add -mpwrx (POWER/2 aka

	N_INDR symbol, set BSF_EXPORT and clear BSF_LOCAL.

	* config/tc-mips.c (append_insn): If EMBEDDED_PIC, don't swap a
	branch with an instruction that uses $at, in case the branch is
	later expanded.
	(macro): If EMBEDDED_PIC, case M_JAL_A may use $at.
	(md_pcrel_from): If not OBJ_AOUT, return 4 for an undefined symbol
	to make it pcrel_offset.
	(tc_gen_reloc): If not OBJ_AOUT, set the reloc addend to
	reloc->address; another gruesome hack to get gas reloc handling to
	do the right thing.

Thu Mar 24 21:29:29 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-alpha.c (alpha_ip): Only set GP prolog size if using

	LITERAL reloc, cleared by anything that generates a LITUSE reloc,
	tested by code that might want to emit a LITUSE reloc.
	(emit_unaligned_io): New function.  Currently calls md_assemble,
	but it should eventually be converted to generate the insn itself
	and call emit_insn directly.
	(emit_load_unal, emit_store_unal, emit_byte_manip_r,
	emit_extract_r, emit_insert_r, emit_mask_r, emit_sign_extend,
	emit_bis_r): Likewise.

Wed Mar 23 16:06:08 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-mips.c (md_parse_option): For -membedded-pic, force
	the -G value to 0x7fffffff.  For SVR4 PIC options, don't call
	bfd_set_gp_size here, it's done in md_begin.  Don't permit -G with
	-membedded-pic.
	(mips_force_relocation): New function.

	(load_address): Handle EMBEDDED_PIC.
	(macro): Handle EMBEDDED_PIC in all PIC cases.
	(md_parse_option): Accept -membedded-pic to use EMBEDDED_PIC.  If
	OBJ_ELF, accept -KPIC and -call_shared to use SVR4_PIC and accept
	-non_shared to use NO_PIC (this is how the Irix 5 assembler
	works).  Do not permit -G with SVR4_PIC.
	(s_abicalls): Warn if -G was used, and force -G 0.
	(tc_gen_reloc): Set reloc->addend to 0 for a PC relative reloc for
	anything but a.out, not just for ELF.  For ECOFF, don't generate a
	BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL_S2 reloc unless using EMBEDDED_PIC.

	* config/obj-ecoff.h (obj_sec_sym_ok_for_reloc): Define to be 1.

Sun Mar 20 14:43:14 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (config-stamp): If `defs' is defined, emit a
	preprocessor directive to create a macro named by this value into
	config.new; don't explicitly go for BFD_ASSEMBLER.
	* configure.in: Define `defs', not `BFDDEF'.  Set it to
	MANY_SEGMENTS for any obj-coffbfd target.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h (BFD_HEADERS, BFD): Define.
	* config/i386coff.mt (TDEFINES): Don't define BFD, MANY_SEGMENTS,

	bfd_set_symtab is called.
	(dump_section_relocs): Note whether a symbol is a section symbol
	or not.
	(adjust_reloc_syms): For now, always supply an absolute symbol for
	fixups without symbols but not yet `done'.  Use section_symbol to
	get the symbol, instead of going directly for abs_symbol.
	(write_relocs) [DEBUG4]: Abort if any symbol referred to by a
	reloc is not a section symbol and is not in the symbol table.
	(set_symtab): New function, broken out from write_object_file.
	Counts symbol table instead of relying on an earlier count.
	(write_object_file): Call set_symtab, but do it after potentially
	invoking the *_frob_file macros.  Don't bother counting symbols.
	Call symbol_remove, instead of expanding it in place.  Moved the
	conditionalized `object_file_size' declaration down to
	conditionalized block where it's used.  When using the absolute
	symbol for a fixup without a symbol, set sy_used_in_reloc.
	(write_object_file) [BFD_ASSEMBLER]: Call section_symbol to get
	the correct symbol for the absolute section.

	* subsegs.c (section_symbol): Use symbol_new instead of
	symbol_make, since we may want it to go into the symbol table.
	Make the new symbol have internal linkage.  If
	obj_sec_sym_ok_for_reloc says it's okay, use the BFD section
	symbol with the newly created GAS symbol.
	(obj_sec_sym_ok_for_reloc): Default to always returning 0.
	* config/obj-aout.h (obj_sec_sym_ok_for_reloc) [BFD_ASSEMBLER]:
	New macro.

	(sparc_ip, label "immediate"): Reject constants for pcrel
	instructions only if the relocation type indicates a "call"
	instruction and the offset is within range of a "jmpl %g0".  If
	it's not in range, use the absolute section symbol plus an offset.
	(md_apply_fix): Use in_signed_range.  Combined _SPARC13 and
	_BASE13 cases.
	(tc_gen_reloc): Permit BFD_RELOC_SPARC13.

	* config/ic960coff.mt (TDEFINES): Fixed typo (MANY_SECTIONS, not
	MANY_SEGMENTS).

	* configure.in: Eliminated all targets using obj-coff but not
	defining BFD_ASSEMBLER; I think all such targets that are
	supported will be matched by real CPU-OS combinations earlier in
	the case statement.
	(targets *-*-coff*, *-sysv*, *-*-sco*, *-*-sysv32): Deleted.  Made
	some comments about the dpx2 configuration, but left it disabled,
	since it couldn't be reached before.
	(target a29k-amd-ebmonold): Deleted.

Thu Mar 17 13:36:09 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	the 'j' operand if there are no further alternatives for this
	instruction.

	* config/obj-coffbfd.c (adjust_stab_section): Initialize
	stabstrseg to SEG_UNKNOWN, not -1.  After loop, check whether it
	is not SEG_UNKNOWN rather than checking whether it is >= 0.

	* config/tc-mips.c (mips_align): Take new argument, label, and use
	it instead of global insn_label.
	(s_align, s_cons, s_float_cons, s_gpword): Save insn_label before
	call to mips_emit_delay and pass it to mips_align.

Wed Mar 16 11:54:12 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

        * config/tc-hppa.c (pa_equ): Handle both .reg and .equ correctly.

	* config/tc-hppa.c (pa_callinfo): Accept "millicode" as an
	argument to a .callinfo directive.  Don't loop forever on errors.

	field.  (Also from Holger Teutsch.)  Watch for a would-be register
	mask that spans frags.

	* config/obj-coffbfd.c (obj_coff_line): Set symbol lnno field with
	this_base, not line_base.  (Patch from Andreas Arens,
	ari@obelix.av.rwth-aachen.de.)

	* config/obj-aout.c (obj_crawl_symbol_chain): Retain symbols that
	look local if they're exported or undefined.  Used to be done for
	i960 only.

	Get it from the looked-up symbol, instead of using the string from
	the input stream, which is no longer null-terminated.

	(lex_type): Use it for `%'.

	* config/tc-vax.c (md_parse_option): Handle `-h#' option for VMS.

	BFD_RELOC_MIPS_GPREL.  Added new case a.
	(set_at, load_register, macro): Changed calls to macro_build to
	pass new argument for i, j and o cases.

	the .subspace directive.  Likewise for the section alignment.
	Pass the current space to update_subspace and create_new_subspace.
	(pa_spaces_begin): Only use space/subspace aliases if USE_ALIASES

	subspace encountered.  When not using aliases replace the default
	text, data, and bss segments with new ones.
	(create_new_subspace): When not using aliases each subspace has a

	are only used within tc-hppa.c static.  PARAMize all functions.
	Add comments to functions.  Delete unused functions, variables,
	#defines, etc.  Delete unused members within structures.  Delete
	ldil;ble hacks -- it is believed they were installed to work
	around old gas bugs.   Avoid using mixed case for local
	functions, variables, and structures.  Fix formatting problems
	not found by GNU-indent.  Add FIXME notices for things which
	should be worked on the near future.  Delete lots of old
	useless (1.36 PA-SOM) code.

	prototypes for all static functions.  Moved existing minimal
	debugging format support info #ifndef OBJ_ECOFF blocks.
	(macro_build_lui): Eliminated sign_extend argument, because ECOFF

	redundant, and triggers a VMS gcc compiler bug.

	* write.c (write_object_file): Macro SUB_SEGMENT_ALIGN now takes
	current segment as an argument.  (Ignored in all cases but VMS.)
	All callers and definitions changed.

Tue Mar  2 11:56:19 1993  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	Should use aout.

	* Makefile.in (Makefile): Depends on configure.in.

	* config/tc-mips.c (append_insn): Don't check for alignment of
	frag in memory; alignment of instructions in section is a separate
	matter.

	C availability.

	* listing.h: Always provide function declarations, not macros, so
	pcc won't lose.

	* expr.c: Add "const" modifier to hex_value.
	* symbols.c: Finish conversion to S_* macros in the VMS only
	  parts of the program.  Add "const" modifier to
	  md_[long,short]_jump_size. Remove declaration of const_flag

	* write.c: Add "const" modifier to md_[long,short]_jump_size.
	  Fix arguments to VMS_write_object_file.
	* config-gas.com: New file.  Script for VMS systems to set up the

	local_bss_counter.
	* symbols.c, symbols.h (local_bss_counter): Removed.

	argument, rather than using local_bss_counter.

	(size_section): Restored sanity check.
	(do_relocs_for): Base section address on s_paddr rather than
	computing it.  Adjust a29k R_IHIHALF special case to account for
	section paddr (used to require paddr to be zero).  If there are no
	reclos, set s_relptr to 0.  Set relocation size in object_headers.
	(fill_section): Always set s_vaddr here, removing
	ZERO_BASED_SEGMENTS case.  Force s_scnptr for bss to 0.  Don't set

	(do_linenos_for): Set lineno size in object_headers.
	(write_object_file): Use H_{SET,GET}_* macros.  Don't bother to
	set s_vaddr here.  If string_byte_count remains 4, set it back to

	fill_section before do_relocs_for and do_linenos_for.
	(obj_coff_section): Handle optional quoted second argument giving
	section characteristics.
	(obj_coff_bss): Added to handle .bss.
	(obj_coff_ident): Added to handle .ident (puts string in .comment
	section).

	(fixup_mdeps): Change to segment.  Call frag_wane after
	md_convert_frag.
	(fixup_segment): Explicitly check S_IS_COMMON before making 386
	adjustment (already happened only for common symbols, but this is
	clearer).

	(obj_coff_endef): Don't merge labels or symbols awaiting forward
	definitions, and don't merge tags with non-tags.  Check for .bf
	rather than just checking whether the second character is b and
	the third character is f.
	(obj_coff_val): gcc can generate values which we don't handle
	correctly; discard information for now, since it only affects the
	debugging information.
	(tag_find_or_name): Don't insert tags in the symbol table.
	(yank_symbols): Don't merge labels.
	(write_object_file): Don't define SUB_SEGMENT_ALIGN if it is

	the strerror, like perror does.

Wed Sep  9 11:06:25 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	than install_operand.

Tue Aug 25 15:13:48 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac@thepub.cygnus.com)

	* messages.c (as_warn): Use fputs, not fprintf, with a buffer that
	has already been formatted (but may still contain %-characters).
	(as_bad): Likewise.

Wed Aug 19 11:20:59 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* tc-m68k.c, tc-m68kmote.c: the cas2 instruction is supposed to be
	written with indirection on the last two operands, which can be

	* read.c (potable): Revert sac's incorrect change made Jul 13.

	* expr.c: If an expression is single comma, then return with
	SEG_ABSENT rather than an error - since the sparc front end does
	really strange things with things like fbge,a

	* as.h: include bfd.h if using many sections
	* expr.c: LOCAL_LABELS_FB had been changed to lower case - so
	local labels didn't work.
	* listing.c (list_symbol_table): don't core dump when there's no
	symbol there.
	* write.c, write.h: call fix_new with the right number of args on
	the H8.
	* config/tc-h8300.[ch] : fix bugs reported by HMSI, and make
	errors nices

Sat Feb 22 12:26:28 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* app.c: MRI compatibility - allow single quote to start a string.
	* as.c: fix typo recently introduced.
	* as.h : Don't include aout/reloc.h - it's not right for COFF!
	* expr.c: Much rewriting, to accomodate MRI syntax for
	expressions. Also easier to read now.
	* listing.c: Put back defuns
	* read.c: modified to accept MRI syntax, put back listing pseudo
	ops so that an assembler built with NO_LISTING ignores list ops
	rather than pukes.
	* write.c, write.h: fixs - only keep a reloc type in a fix if the target
	machine is a SPARC or a 29K.
	* config/obj-aout.c: added s_sect pseudo op
	* config/obj-coffbfd.c: lints, set the filehdr flags right and
	fill in the timestamp.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h: Since we don't include aout/reloc.h
	anymore, define all the relocs which the tc-<x> bit will use so we
	can translate from them to the coff types.
	* config/tc-a29k.c: reloc_type isn't ane enum any more
	* config/tc-m68k.c: Added NO_RELOC definition.

Fri Feb 21 06:21:07 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: put header files before C source for TAGS; remove

	* obj-aout.c: do not include stab.gnu.h if NO_LISTING.

	* tc-i860.c, a.out.gnu.h: move i860 relocs to a proper place.

	* a.out.h: removed.

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  Minh Tran-Le (TRANLE@INTELLICORP.COM)

	* symbols.c (local_label_name): symbols now start with ^A.

	* read.c, subsegs.c, write.c obj-coff.c: added handling of
	  `.bss` pseudo op for unitialized data. The new gcc (1.37.9x)
	  generate these sections.  .align: will use NOP_OPCODE or 0
	  for padding. This is just for being nice to the
	  disassembler.

	* expr.c (operand): changed to generate local label "\001L0"
	  starting with a ^A so that it is recognized as a local label.

	* as.c (perform_an_assembly_pass): zero bss_fix_root, too.

	* tc-i386.c: tc-i386.c: added handling of the following opcodes:
	  i/o opcodes - inb, inw, outb and outw.  string manipulation with
	  att syntax - scmp, slod, smov, ssca, ssto.

	* obj-coff.c: (for aix386) Moved the symbols .text, .data and .bss
	  to just after .file .

	  In obj_crawl_symbol_chain() where it tries to put the external
	  symbols apart, with the condition:
	    (!S_IS_DEFINED(symbolP) &&
	     !S_IS_DEBUG(symbolP) &&
	     !SF_GET_STATICS(symbolP))
	  it was moving too many symbols out. So I switch it back to the
	  condition:
	    (S_GET_STORAGE_CLASS(symbolP) == C_EXT && !SF_GET_FUNCTION(symbolP))

	  In obj_emit_relocations() added the conditional on KEEP_RELOC_INFO
	  so that we don't use the F_RELFLG which make the linker complain
	  that somebody has stripped the relocation info.

	  Also, the AIX ld program require that the relocation table
	  is sorted by r_vaddr like the standard ATT assembler does.

	  [he also changed the sizeof(struct ...)'s into the coff
	  style FOOSZ macros.  I'm not sure this is right, but I can't
	  remember why.  xoxorich.]

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, doc: use the doc.  Build it, install
	  it, clean it, etc.

Tue Feb 18 02:21:25 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* read.c: white space and comments only.

	* configure.in: use the new atof-ns32.c for ns32k.

	* write.c: comment change only.

	* tc-m88k.[hc]: pulled in from hack's unfinished work.  These
	  aren't yet integrated.

	* tc-i860.[hc]: blew off the dust.  Something must still be done
	  about conflicting relocation types.

	* tc-ns32k.c: Replaced previous tc_aout_fix_to_chars stub with the
	  real thing.

	* tc-i960.c, tc-sparc.c: white space and comments only.

	* tc-a29k.h: delete duplicate macro definition.

	* new file atof-ns32k.c copied from hack's last unreleased gas.

Mon Feb 17 07:51:06 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-ns32k.c: actually make tc_aout_fix_to_chars work
	  rather than abort.

	* nearly everything.  flush ChangeLog, package as gas-1.92.1.
	  ChangeLog's prior to this are sketchy at best.  I have logs.
	  They just aren't ChangeLogs.
