# The am33 cr16 crx ft32 mn10* msp430 nds32* and rl78 targets do not evaluate the subtraction of symbols at assembly time.
# The bfin target does not allow .subsection with an equated symbol as operand.
# The d30v target emits sufficiently different debug info, apparently also covering padding it inserts.
# The riscv targets do not support the subtraction of symbols.
