	Changes from: David Mosberger-Tang  <davidm@azstarnet.com>

	* NEWS:  Add Alpha Linux as a new native configuration.

	* mdebugread.c (parse_symbol): When we find a malloc() symbol with
 	return type VOID, assume no debugging info is available for that
 	object file and patch the return value into VOID *.  Otherwise,
	operations requiring an implicit call to malloc() will fail.

	* infrun.c (wait_for_inferior): The criterion to detect entering a
 	sigtramp handler is now: (a) the current pc is inside a sigtramp
 	handler, (b) the previous pc is not in a sigtramp handler, and (c)
 	the current stack pointer is "inner" than the old one.  Condition
	(c) is new to avoid mistaking a return from a signal handler into
 	sigtramp as a new sigtramp invocation.

	* dcache.c (struct dcache_block): Declare addr as CORE_ADDR.  An
 	int may not be big enough to hold an address.
	(dcache_hit): Ditto.
	(dcache_peek_byte): Fix indentation.

	* configure: Rebuild

	* config/alpha/alpha-osf1.mh (XM_FILE): Change from xm-alpha.h to
 	xm-alphaosf.h.
	* config/alpha/alpha-osf2.mh: Ditto.

	* blockframe.c (find_pc_partial_function): Pass PC to
 	SIGTRAMP_START and SIGTRAMP_END macros for the benefit of systems
 	that detect sigtramp code via designated code sequences (as is the
 	case for Linux/Alpha, for example).
	
	* config/i386/tm-i386bsd.h: Change SIGTRAMP_START and SIGTRAMP_END
	to ignore new PC argument.
	* config/m68k/tm-hp300bsd.h: Ditto.
	* config/vax/tm-vax.h: Ditto.

	* alpha-tdep.c (alpha_linux_sigtramp_offset): New function.
	(alpha_osf_skip_sigtramp_frame): Ditto.
	(push_sigtramp_desc): Ditto.
	(alpha_find_saved_regs): Use SIGCONTEXT_ADDR macro to extract
 	sigcontext address from frame.
	(alpha_saved_pc_after_call): When in sigtramp, use
 	alpha_frame_saved_pc() instead of read-register().
	(after_prologue): When inside a dynamically generated sigtramp
 	function, there is no prologue, so return address of first
 	instruction.
	(alpha_in_prologue): Fix typo in comment.
	(find_proc_desc): Use macro DYNAMIC_SIGTRAMP_OFFSET to determine
 	whether we're inside a dynamicaly generated sigtramp function.  If
 	so, create and push and appropriate procedure descriptor.
	(alpha_frame_chain): Use macro FRAME_PAST_SIGTRAMP_FRAME to obtain
 	the frame past a sigtramp frame (if the current frame is indeed a
 	sigtramp function).
	(init_extra_frame_info): Don't read next frame register off of
 	stack-pointer when inside a dynamiccaly generated sigtramp.
	(alpha_pop_frame): Also unlink and destroy procedure descriptors
 	created for dynamically generated sigtramp functions.

	* alpha-nat.c: When compiling under Linux, include <asm/reg.h> and
 	<alpha/ptrace.h> instead of <machine/reg.h>

	Prototypes for new functions in utils.c.

	type of second arg to "char *" to be type compatible with
	dcache.
	(remote_wait): Cast second arg to strtol to correct type.
	* hppa-tdep.c (compare_unwind_entries): Change argument types to
	"const void *" to be type compatible with qsort, and then
