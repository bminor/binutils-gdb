	GDBTK_LIBRARY was set.
 	* gdbtk_cmds.c: New file - this contains all the Tcl commands that
	gdb defines.  All the old commands were moved here, the
	string-based commands were converted to object commands, and the
	object-based commands were all converted to uniformly use the

	commands.  This way the obj commands will also go through

	enabling I/O interrupts for SVR4 (streams).
	* (start_saving_output save_output get_saved_output
	finish_saving_output flush_holdbuf gdbtk_flush gdbtk_fputs
	gdbtk_init):
	Totally revamp to use TCLs dynamic string functions.  Also, quote
	all data passed back to TCL to prevent errors with unmatched
	braces, odd characters, etc...  This fixes several wierd problems
	with outputting strings containing unmatched braces.
	* (breakpoint_notify gdb_loc):  Use long hex format to output
	addresses of breakpoints and PCs.  This fixes some Alpha problems.
	* (breakpoint_notify):  Add stream arg to call to gdbtk_fputs.
	* (gdb_listfiles):  Also, go through the symtabs when looking for
	files.  This makes xcoff work (sort of), but probably breaks
	something else.
	* (gdb_stop):  Return TCL_OK instead of nothing.  This fixes odd
	TCL errors when hitting stop button.
	* (tk_command):  Don't pass interp->result on to Tcl_{Var}Eval, as
	that will trash the result.  strdup the result instead and pass
	that on.  Improve error handling as well.

	* gdbtk.tcl (gdbtk_tcl_flush):  Use global def of
	current_output_win.  Makes flushing actually work!
	* (asm_win_name create_asm_win update_assembly):  Bunch of fixes
	to make assembly windows stop flashing when loading a new file.
	* (gdbtk_tcl_busy gdbtk_tcl_idle):  Use catch to prevent gdb_cmd
	errors from losing control.
	* (create_source_window):  Add source file selection to View menu.
	* (create_command_window (<Key-Return> binding):  Quote text fed
	into gdb_cmd to prevent eval errors.

Thu Dec 15 16:40:10 1994  Stu Grossman  (grossman@cygnus.com)

	* gdbtk.c: Improve mechanism for capturing output values.
	(full_filename): Remove.
	(gdb_cmd call_wrapper gdbtk_init): Protect all calls from tcl land
	with call_wrapper.  This prevents longjmps (usually via error())
	from jumping out of tcl/tk and leaving things in an indeterminate
	state.
	(gdbtk_fputs): Differentiate stdout from stderr when passing text
	into tcl land.
	* gdbtk.tcl: New view option to disable line numbers.  Put catch
	around most uses of gdb_cmd.  Add update button to reg config
	window.  Stop doing immediate updates when selecting registers.
	Change register view values into checkbuttons.

	displaying all registers.

	* gdbtk.tcl:  Use monochrome color model for now.
	* (delete_breakpoint_tag create_file_win):  Add breakdot support.
	* (create_file_win create_asm_win update_listing build_framework
	create_source_window create_command_window):  Re-org window
	creation to give all windows consistent look and feel.
	* (update_listing update_asm):  Change pc pointer to '->'.
	* (registers_command reg_config_menu create_registers_window
	populate_reg_window update_registers):  Revamp register window.
	Allow selection of registers to be displayed.  Highlight changed
	registers.

	* gdbtk.c (gdb_sourcelines):  Returns list of source lines
	containing code.  (gdb_regnames):  Returns list of register names.

	* Makefile.in:  Use $(objdir)/tcl and $(objdir)/tk if they are
	available.
	* configure.in (ENABLE_CLIBS):  Use $(TCL) and $(TK) instead of
	-ltcl and -ltk.
	* gdbtk.c:  Get rid of lots of unnecessary #includes.
	* (gdbtk_init):  Use ConnectionNumber macro instead of referencing
	Display structure directly.
	* gdbtk.tcl:  Change exit button to quit button.

Wed Oct 26 15:41:07 1994  Stu Grossman  (grossman@cygnus.com)

	* gdbtk.c: Change sense and name of no_windows variable.  Now
 	called use_windows, and defaults to off (for compatibility).

Thu Oct 20 17:35:45 1994  Stu Grossman  (grossman@cygnus.com)

	* gdbtk.c (gdb_cmd):  Force GUI into idle mode when errors occur.

	alert GUI of target state changes.

	to just set or clear breakpoints when in the margin tag.
	* Change shape of register window to be more vertical to better
