/* ANSI and traditional C compatibility macros

   ANSI C is assumed if __STDC__ is #defined.

	Macros
		PTR		- Generic pointer type
		LONG_DOUBLE	- `long double' type
		CONST		- `const' keyword
		VOLATILE	- `volatile' keyword
		SIGNED		- `signed' keyword
		PTRCONST	- Generic const pointer (void *const)

	EXFUN(name, prototype)		- declare external function NAME
					  with prototype PROTOTYPE
	DEFUN(name, arglist, args)	- define function NAME with
					  args ARGLIST of types in ARGS
	DEFUN_VOID(name)		- define function NAME with no args
	AND				- argument separator for ARGS
	NOARGS				- null arglist
	DOTS				- `...' in args

    For example:
	extern int EXFUN(printf, (CONST char *format DOTS));
	int DEFUN(fprintf, (stream, format),
		  FILE *stream AND CONST char *format DOTS) { ... }
	void DEFUN_VOID(abort) { ... }
