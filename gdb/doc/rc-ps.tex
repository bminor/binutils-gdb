% To choose PS fonts (Karl Berry TeX fontnames) for the refcard, link
% or copy this file to rcfonts.tex
% 
%The Times-Roman family is both more attractive and more compact than 
%Computer Modern.  On the other hand, while common, it is not free.  
%There are three sets of font definitions:
%  1) rc-cm.tex uses the free (Computer Modern) fonts
%  2) rc-ps.tex uses common PostScript fonts, with fontnames from the
%  Karl Berry scheme recommended in the documentation for dvips.
%  3) rc-pslong.tex uses common PostScript fonts, with the long names
%  used by PostScript programs directly.
%
% One caution: due to differing character ordering between TeX and PS,
%if your TeX is pre-3.0, or if you don't have virtual Courier
%matching the TeX character positions, you might want to use CMtt for
%\tt even if you switch to PostScript fonts for the rest of the text.
