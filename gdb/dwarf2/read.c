   (a dwarf2_cu object exists for this CU, and `dwarf2_per_objfile::get_cu`

   The caller is therefore not required to load the CU's DIEs (we return false)
   if:

     - the CU is already expanded, and therefore does not get enqueued
     - the CU gets enqueued for expansion, but its DIEs are already loaded

   Note that the caller should not use this function's return value as an

/* DWP file .debug_{cu,tu}_index section format:
   [ref: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFissionDWP]
   [ref: http://dwarfstd.org/doc/DWARF5.pdf, sect 7.3.5 "DWARF Package Files"]

   DWP Versions 1 & 2 are older, pre-standard format versions.  The first
   officially standard DWP format was published with DWARF v5 and is called
   Version 5.  There are no versions 3 or 4.

   DWP Version 1:

   Both index sections have the same format, and serve to map a 64-bit
   signature to a set of section numbers.  Each section begins with a header,
   followed by a hash table of 64-bit signatures, a parallel table of 32-bit
   indexes, and a pool of 32-bit section numbers.  The index sections will be
   aligned at 8-byte boundaries in the file.

   The index section header consists of:

    V, 32 bit version number
    -, 32 bits unused
    N, 32 bit number of compilation units or type units in the index
    M, 32 bit number of slots in the hash table

   Numbers are recorded using the byte order of the application binary.

   The hash table begins at offset 16 in the section, and consists of an array
   of M 64-bit slots.  Each slot contains a 64-bit signature (using the byte
   order of the application binary).  Unused slots in the hash table are 0.
   (We rely on the extreme unlikeliness of a signature being exactly 0.)

   The parallel table begins immediately after the hash table
   (at offset 16 + 8 * M from the beginning of the section), and consists of an
   array of 32-bit indexes (using the byte order of the application binary),
   corresponding 1-1 with slots in the hash table.  Each entry in the parallel
   table contains a 32-bit index into the pool of section numbers.  For unused
   hash table slots, the corresponding entry in the parallel table will be 0.

   The pool of section numbers begins immediately following the hash table
   (at offset 16 + 12 * M from the beginning of the section).  The pool of
   section numbers consists of an array of 32-bit words (using the byte order
   of the application binary).  Each item in the array is indexed starting
   from 0.  The hash table entry provides the index of the first section
   number in the set.  Additional section numbers in the set follow, and the
   set is terminated by a 0 entry (section number 0 is not used in ELF).

   In each set of section numbers, the .debug_info.dwo or .debug_types.dwo
   section must be the first entry in the set, and the .debug_abbrev.dwo must
   be the second entry. Other members of the set may follow in any order.

   ---

   DWP Versions 2 and 5:

   DWP Versions 2 and 5 combine all the .debug_info, etc. sections into one,
   and the entries in the index tables are now offsets into these sections.
   CU offsets begin at 0.  TU offsets begin at the size of the .debug_info
   section.

   Index Section Contents:
    Header
    Hash Table of Signatures   dwp_hash_table.hash_table
    Parallel Table of Indices  dwp_hash_table.unit_table
    Table of Section Offsets   dwp_hash_table.{v2|v5}.{section_ids,offsets}
    Table of Section Sizes     dwp_hash_table.{v2|v5}.sizes

   The index section header consists of:

    V, 32 bit version number
    L, 32 bit number of columns in the table of section offsets
    N, 32 bit number of compilation units or type units in the index
    M, 32 bit number of slots in the hash table

   Numbers are recorded using the byte order of the application binary.

   The hash table has the same format as version 1.
   The parallel table of indices has the same format as version 1,
   except that the entries are origin-1 indices into the table of sections
   offsets and the table of section sizes.

   The table of offsets begins immediately following the parallel table
   (at offset 16 + 12 * M from the beginning of the section).  The table is
   a two-dimensional array of 32-bit words (using the byte order of the
   application binary), with L columns and N+1 rows, in row-major order.
   Each row in the array is indexed starting from 0.  The first row provides
   a key to the remaining rows: each column in this row provides an identifier
   for a debug section, and the offsets in the same column of subsequent rows
   refer to that section.  The section identifiers for Version 2 are:

    DW_SECT_INFO         1  .debug_info.dwo
    DW_SECT_TYPES        2  .debug_types.dwo
    DW_SECT_ABBREV       3  .debug_abbrev.dwo
    DW_SECT_LINE         4  .debug_line.dwo
    DW_SECT_LOC          5  .debug_loc.dwo
    DW_SECT_STR_OFFSETS  6  .debug_str_offsets.dwo
    DW_SECT_MACINFO      7  .debug_macinfo.dwo
    DW_SECT_MACRO        8  .debug_macro.dwo

   The section identifiers for Version 5 are:

    DW_SECT_INFO_V5         1  .debug_info.dwo
    DW_SECT_RESERVED_V5     2  --
    DW_SECT_ABBREV_V5       3  .debug_abbrev.dwo
    DW_SECT_LINE_V5         4  .debug_line.dwo
    DW_SECT_LOCLISTS_V5     5  .debug_loclists.dwo
    DW_SECT_STR_OFFSETS_V5  6  .debug_str_offsets.dwo
    DW_SECT_MACRO_V5        7  .debug_macro.dwo
    DW_SECT_RNGLISTS_V5     8  .debug_rnglists.dwo

   The offsets provided by the CU and TU index sections are the base offsets
   for the contributions made by each CU or TU to the corresponding section
   in the package file.  Each CU and TU header contains an abbrev_offset
   field, used to find the abbreviations table for that CU or TU within the
   contribution to the .debug_abbrev.dwo section for that CU or TU, and should
   be interpreted as relative to the base offset given in the index section.
   Likewise, offsets into .debug_line.dwo from DW_AT_stmt_list attributes
   should be interpreted as relative to the base offset for .debug_line.dwo,
   and offsets into other debug sections obtained from DWARF attributes should
   also be interpreted as relative to the corresponding base offset.

   The table of sizes begins immediately following the table of offsets.
   Like the table of offsets, it is a two-dimensional array of 32-bit words,
   with L columns and N rows, in row-major order.  Each row in the array is
   indexed starting from 1 (row 0 is shared by the two tables).

   ---

   Hash table lookup is handled the same in version 1 and 2:

   We assume that N and M will not exceed 2^32 - 1.
   The size of the hash table, M, must be 2^k such that 2^k > 3*N/2.

   Given a 64-bit compilation unit signature or a type signature S, an entry
   in the hash table is located as follows:

   1) Calculate a primary hash H = S & MASK(k), where MASK(k) is a mask with
      the low-order k bits all set to 1.

   2) Calculate a secondary hash H' = (((S >> 32) & MASK(k)) | 1).

   3) If the hash table entry at index H matches the signature, use that
      entry.  If the hash table entry at index H is unused (all zeroes),
      terminate the search: the signature is not present in the table.

   4) Let H = (H + H') modulo M. Repeat at Step 3.

   Because M > N and H' and M are relatively prime, the search is guaranteed
   to stop at an unused slot or find the match.  */
