     This is also used to work around a difference between the way gold
     generates .gdb_index version <=7 and the way gdb does.  Arguably this
     is a gold bug.  For symbols coming from TUs, gold records in the index
     the CU that includes the TU instead of the TU itself.  This breaks
     dw2_lookup_symbol: It assumes that if the index says symbol X lives
     in CU/TU Y, then one need only expand Y and a subsequent lookup in Y
     will find X.  Alas TUs live in their own symtab, so after expanding CU Y
     we need to look in TU Z to find X.  Fortunately, this is akin to
     DW_TAG_imported_unit, so we just use the same mechanism: For
     .gdb_index version <=7 this also records the TUs that the CU referred
     to.  Concurrently with this change gdb was modified to emit version 8
     indices so we only pay a price for gold generated indices.

/* Start a subfile for DWARF.  FILENAME is the name of the file and

   This routine tries to keep line numbers from identical absolute and
   relative file names in a common subfile.

   Using the `list' example from the GDB testsuite, which resides in
   /srcdir and compiling it with Irix6.2 cc in /compdir using a filename
   of /srcdir/list0.c yields the following debugging information for list0.c:

   DW_AT_name:          /srcdir/list0.c
   DW_AT_comp_dir:      /compdir
   files.files[0].name: list0.h
   files.files[0].dir:  /srcdir
   files.files[1].name: list0.c
   files.files[1].dir:  /srcdir

   The line number information for list0.c has to end up in a single
   subfile, so that `break /srcdir/list0.c:1' works as expected.
   start_subfile will ensure that this happens provided that we pass the
   concatenation of files.files[1].dir and files.files[1].name as the
   subfile's name.  */
