/* Does the current host support the GETFPXREGS request?  The system header
   file may or may not define it, but even if it is defined, the kernel
   will return EIO if it's running on a pre-SSE processor.

   Initially this will be TRIBOOL_UNKNOWN and should be changed to
   TRIBOOL_FALSE if the ptrace call is attempted and fails or changed to
   TRIBOOL_TRUE if the ptrace call is attempted and succeeds.

   My instinct is to attach this to some architecture- or target-specific
   data structure, but really, a particular GDB process can only run on top
   of one kernel at a time.  So it's okay - for this to be a global
   variable.  */
