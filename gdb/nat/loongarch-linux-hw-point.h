/* Each bit of a variable of this type is used to indicate whether a
   hardware breakpoint or watchpoint setting has been changed since
   the last update.

   Bit N corresponds to the Nth hardware breakpoint or watchpoint
   setting which is managed in loongarch_debug_reg_state, where N is
   valid between 0 and the total number of the hardware breakpoint or
   watchpoint debug registers minus 1.

   When bit N is 1, the corresponding breakpoint or watchpoint setting
   has changed, and therefore the corresponding hardware debug
   register needs to be updated via the ptrace interface.

   In the per-thread arch-specific data area, we define two such
   variables for per-thread hardware breakpoint and watchpoint
   settings respectively.

   This type is part of the mechanism which helps reduce the number of
   ptrace calls to the kernel, i.e. avoid asking the kernel to write
   to the debug registers with unchanged values.  */
