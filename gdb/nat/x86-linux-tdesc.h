/* Return the target description for Linux thread TID.

   The storage pointed to by XCR0_STORAGE and XSAVE_LAYOUT_STORAGE must
   exist until the program (GDB or gdbserver) terminates, this storage is
   used to cache the xcr0 and xsave layout values.  The values pointed to
   by these arguments are only updated at most once, the first time this
   function is called if the have_ptrace_getregset global is set to
   TRIBOOL_UNKNOWN.

   This function returns a target description based on the extracted xcr0
   value along with other characteristics of the thread identified by TID.

   This function can return nullptr if we encounter a machine configuration
   for which a target_desc cannot be created.  Ideally this would not be
   the case, we should be able to create a target description for every
   possible machine configuration.  See amd64_linux_read_description and
   i386_linux_read_description for cases when nullptr might be
   returned.  */
