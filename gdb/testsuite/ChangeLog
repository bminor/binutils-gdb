Thu Feb 16 10:30:24 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in, gdb.{base,c++,chill}/Makefile.in (GDB, GDBFLAGS):
	  Removed, these values are set by lib/gdb.exp.

	* lib/gdb.exp: If GDBFLAGS is unset, set it to -nx.

Wed Feb 15 14:23:28 1995  J.T. Conklin  <jtc@rtl.cygnus.com>

	* config/vx-gdb.exp (spawn_vxgdb): Use default_gdb_start instead
	  of replicating gdb startup code.

	* config/mt-vxworks (LDFLAGS): Set to -r.
	  (CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET): Removed.

	* config/vx-gdb.exp: always set prompt; gdb.exp sets it to
	  (gdb) and gdb for vxworks uses (vxgdb).

	* Makefile.in, gdb.{base,c++,chill}/Makefile.in (GDB): If a gdb
	  executable is not in the tree and host != target, use sed and
	  program_transform_name to determine the gdb name used by the
	  target.

	* configure.in, gdb.{base,c++,chill}/configure.in: changed so
	  *-*-vxworks* matches vxworks and *-*-netware* matches NetWare.

	* gdb.base/{callfuncs.exp,callfuncs.c}: Add tests for passing
	floats, chars, and shorts where there are ANSI-style function
	definitions.

	* gdb.base/Makefile.in: Build it.
	* TODO: Remove item about checking that C names don't get C++
	demangling applied; this test tests it.

Thu Feb  9 12:43:56 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.stabs/weird.exp: Remove "Haven't examined" comment which
	went with the const70 xfail.  The xfail went away a year ago.

	* gdb.base/signals.exp: Rename a bunch of tests to give unique names.

	* gdb.base/corefile.exp: Give backtrace test unique name.  xfail
	for hp300.

	* gdb.base/interrupt.exp: Also xfail hpux (for hp300).

	* gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp: Don't run on hp300.

	* Makefile.in (site.exp): Set host_alias and target_alias as well
	as host_triplet and target_triplet.

Wed Feb  1 08:03:48 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp: Invoke stty before starting inferior.

	* gdb.base/nodebug.exp: Add xfails for ultrix and irix5 (same
	places as other ecoff systems).

	* gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp (test_with_self): Don't invoke stty on
	ultrix.

Mon Jan 30 11:44:52 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.base/nodebug.c (inner): Use variables so AIX linker doesn't
	remove them.
	* gdb.base/nodebug.exp: Accept "function" in addition to "text
	variable and "variable" in addition to "data variable".
	* gdb.base/nodebug.exp: xfail datalocal and bsslocal tests for AIX.

	* gdb.base/list.exp (test_forward_search): Set listsize to 4 not
	2.
	* gdb.base/list1.c (long_line): Add additional statement at start
	of function.
	* gdb.base/list.exp (test_forward_search): Update line number to
	reflect new statement.

Sun Jan 29 13:34:25 1995  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* gdb.base/signals.exp:  Reinitialize searched source directories
	after gdb_start call.

Sat Jan 28 01:34:44 1995  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.disasm/Makefile.in (clean): Delete "errs" file.
	* gdb.stabs/Makefile.in: Likewise.

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (all_fpu_comparison_tests): Revert last
	change.  Instead split the tests into smaller pieces.
	* gdb.disasm/hppa.s: Corresponding changes.

Fri Jan 27 09:24:51 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp (test_with_self), gdb.base/interrupt.exp:
	Quote ^C when passing it to stty.  For some shells ^ is a pipe.

	* gdb.base/funcargs.exp: Modify many tests so that every test
	either passes or fails.  Make some test names unique.

Thu Jan 26 19:20:34 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp (test_with_self), gdb.base/interrupt.exp:
	Call stty to set interrupt character.

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.mt (hppa), gdb.stabs/hppa.mt (weird.o): Check
	for HP assembler versus GNU assembler based on actual behavior of
	$(CC), rather than assuming that $(AS) is always the GNU assembler.

	* TODO: Suggest a few more stepping tests.

Wed Jan 25 14:52:41 1995  Stan Shebs  <shebs@andros.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/default.exp: xfail no-stack backtraces for h8300,
	restart GDB for h8300 after a continue.
	(return): Add pattern to match a29k-udi behavior.
	* gdb.base/nodebug.exp: Remove obsolete comment.
	* gdb.base/regs.exp: New file, testing of register displays.

	* gdb.base/whatis.exp: Always start with a fresh GDB.

Wed Jan 25 11:12:07 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (all_fpu_comparison_tests): Set timeout
	higher, these tests generate a lot of output.

Tue Jan 24 07:58:44 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* lib/gdb.exp (gdb_test): Remove catch from around the send.  The
	code following the catch silently ignored some errors; without the
	catch they should be thrown like any other tcl error.  Also, the
	catch used "" instead of {} which meant all the callers who wanted
	to include one of the characters "[]$ had to quote it an extra time.
	* gdb.base/{callfuncs.exp,commands.exp,gdbvars.exp,printcmds.exp,
	ptype.exp,signals.exp,watchpoint.exp}, gdb.c++/{cplusfuncs.exp,
	demangle.exp}, gdb.chill/chexp.exp, gdb.fortran/exprs.exp:
	Remove extra quoting.

Mon Jan 23 21:57:54 1995  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.base/commands.exp: Make test names unique; every test either
	passes or fails.  Update some comments.

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (do_system_control_tests): Update.

Sat Jan 21 15:34:52 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	The following fixes a FAIL caused by the fact that the alpha stabs
	configuration didn't use the ".if alpha" code in weird.def.
	* gdb.stabs/weird.def (v_comb): Use type attribute to specify 32
	bit pointer, so the 32 bit version works even on the alpha.
	* gdb.stabs/{alpha.mt,ecoff.mt,aout.sed,hppa.sed,xcoff.sed,weird.def}:
	Remove the stuff which allowed us to have separate versions for
	alpha and everything else.

	* gdb.c++/cplusfuncs.exp (test_lookup_operator_functions): Fix
	regexp which "info func operator\[\](" is supposed to match.  Fix
	string to send to GDB.  Note that GDB still doesn't work right.  Add a
	new test for "info func .perator\[\](" which GDB does handle correctly.

	* gdb.base/nodebug.exp: xfail most of the new tests for ecoff systems.

Fri Jan 20 12:14:23 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.c++/classes.exp, gdb.c++/cplusfuncs.exp,
	gdb.c++/inherit.exp, gdb.c++/templates.exp, gdb.c++/virtfunc.exp,
	gdb.fortran/exprs.exp, gdb.fortran/types.exp, gdb.chill/chexp.exp,
	gdb.base/printcmds.exp: Remove passcount, failcount, etc., stuff;
	it makes the tests harder to understand and confuses test-o-matic.
	The preferred style is that each test provides a PASS or a FAIL,
	and has a unique message (e.g. "continue #54" not just "continue")
	which is the same for the pass and the fail.
	* gdb.fortran/exprs.exp, gdb.fortran/types.exp,
	gdb.chill/chexp.exp: Move test_print_accept and test_print_reject
	to lib/gdb.exp.
	* gdb.base/printcmds.exp: Use test_print_accept.  Remove
	prt_accept which was basically the same thing.  Likewise for
	test_print_reject and prt_reject.
	* lib/gdb.exp (test_print_reject): Add some more error message
	patterns to match from the former printcmds.exp (prt_reject).
	* gdb.c++/classes.exp, gdb.base/scope.exp: Remove spurious xfails.
	One defect of the passcount stuff is that some of it failed to
	report XPASS where appropriate.
	* gdb.c++/cplusfuncs.exp (print_addr_of): No longer accept extra
	stuff before and after arg in expected pattern.
	(test_paddr_operator_functions): Re-do test without print_addr_of;
	this is the only test which seems to want extra stuff there.

Tue Jan 17 10:47:53 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/nodebug.exp: Update new tests to reflect improved
	wording of gdb output.

	* gdb.base/nodebug.exp: Add tests to check that "print", "whatis"
	and "ptype" work on variables in files compiled without -g.
	Replaces commented out "maint print msymbol" tests.

Mon Jan 16 12:13:28 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/setvar.c (dummy): Call malloc.

	* gdb.stabs/aout.sed: Enclose comments within a sed command to avoid
	losing with the irix4 sed.

	* gdb.base/sigall.exp (test_one_sig): Add xfail for "get signal
	ALRM" on irix4.

Sun Jan 15 21:58:26 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com>

	* TODO: Remove items about corefile.exp testing new exec-file and
	backtrace; both are now done.  Add items about printing enums.

Sat Jan 14 11:25:28 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/sigall.exp (test_one_sig): Attempt to recover if
	"get signal $thissig" test fails.

	* gdb.base/setvar.exp: Check for and reject crazy expected type hacks.

Thu Jan 12 01:14:53 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/sigall.c (gen_*): Pass argument to handle_* to avoid
	compiler warning with dec alpha compiler.

	* gdb.base/commands.exp (if_while_breakpoint_command_test): Remove
	extra \n from gdb_test call (this explains why the prompt test
	that I removed yesterday was there).
	(user_defined_command_test): Remove extra \n and prompt test.

	* gdb.base/sigall.c: If SIGABRT == SIGLOST, just act as if SIGLOST
	doesn't exist.  Likewise if SIGIO == SIGPOLL, pretend SIGPOLL
	doesn't exist.
	* gdb.base/sigall.exp: Remove special handling for SIGIO and SIGPOLL.
	Also remove alpha workaround, which turns out to be because
	SIGABRT == SIGLOST.

	* gdb.base/sigall.exp: Add workaround for alpha weirdness.

	* gdb.base/help.exp: Don't test "help show".

Wed Jan 11 14:37:04 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/commands.exp: Call gdb_exit and gdb_start so that
	"set print address" is on.
	* gdb.base/commands.exp (if_while_breakpoint_command_test): Don't
	pass prompt to gdb_test; gdb_test already looks for the prompt.

	* gdb.base/help.exp: Replace most of docstring for "define" with ".*".

	* gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp: Don't test "maint dump-me".  That test
	was a vestige of the manual TESTSTRATEGY, and the purpose of it
	was to make sure that gdb can read a core file.  But (a) the "read
	the corefile" part didn't make it to a1-selftest.exp, we just
	delete the corefile after creating it, and (b) we test reading
	corefiles in corefile.exp anyway.  Also, this test left around a
	xgdb process on Solaris.

	* gdb.base/corefile.exp: Also test backtrace.

Wed Jan 11 00:14:40 1995  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.base/commands.exp: Test a simple user defined command with
	arguments and if/while statements; verify the full user command is
	printed by "show user".

	* gdb.base/commands.exp: Test if/while commands as part of a
	breakpoint command list; verify they appear in breakpoint
	information.

Wed Jan 11 00:47:58 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/sigall.c (gen_FPE): Generate SIGFPE with kill() rather
	than by dividing by zero.

Tue Jan 10 21:38:05 1995  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.base/watchpoint.exp: hppa*-*-*bsd* no longer has problems
	performing an inferior call with watchpoints enabled.
	* gdb.base/watchpoint.c (main): Delete second unnecessary read
	call.

Tue Jan 10 18:42:07 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.stabs/weird.exp: Allow spaces followed by backspaces in echo
	of "file" command.

	* gdb.c++/classes.exp (test_ptype_class_objects, ptype class Foo):
	Add additional pattern for when "int operator int(void);" appears
	in a different order.

Mon Jan  9 16:22:46 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/signals.exp: Call gdb_exit and gdb_start.

	* gdb.base/help.exp: Replace most of docstrings for "info signals"
	and "signal" with ".*".

Wed Jan  4 11:35:19 1995  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* TODO: Add note about "handle all nostop".

	* gdb.base/{sigall.c, sigall.exp}: New test.
	* gdb.base/Makefile.in: Add it.

	when invoking GDB, suppresses any windowing interface.

Mon Jan  2 17:40:21 1995  Stan Shebs  <shebs@andros.cygnus.com>

	* config/sim-gdb: New file, simulator testing support.

Wed Dec 28 12:21:50 1994  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.base/interrupt.exp: Test calling func1 twice.

Wed Dec 21 12:51:37 1994  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@deneb.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/list.exp (test_forward_search): Set timeout higher
	when we'll be getting lots of output from gdb.

	* gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp: Move code that was inside expect -re
	"init_malloc" to after the expect statement.  Run it if that
	regexp is taken, but also for two others which happen if source
	cannot be found.

Tue Dec 20 12:35:21 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.base/printcmds.exp: New test, for printing register before
	program is running.

	* TODO: Add item regarding large frames.

	* gdb.base/{funcargs.exp, funcargs.c} (call_after_alloca): New test.

	* TODO: Remove item about enabling return.exp; it
	is enabled.  Suggest a few more "return" tests.

Sat Dec 17 02:33:37 1994  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* gdb.c++/misc.cc, gdb.c++/inherit.exp:  Add testcases for
	anonymous unions.

Tue Dec 13 11:26:00 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.chill/Makefile.in: Put all rule before rules for pr-4975.o
	and pr-5646.o, so "make" is the same as "make all", not "make
	pr-4975.o".

Wed Dec  7 19:02:02 1994  Stan Shebs  <shebs@andros.cygnus.com>

	* gdb.base/list.exp: Adjust expectations to reflect changes in
	list1.c.
	(test_forward_search): New test proc.

	* gdb.c++/templates.exp:  Add testcases for printing of template
	types, setting breakpoints on template methods and calling a
	template method.

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (branch_tests): Allow any symbol as the
	branch target since some assemblers (gas-2.5)  may emit a
	relocation for the branch instead of resolving it in the
	assembler.

Sat Oct 29 02:40:40 1994  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* gdb.base/a1-selftest.exp:  Remove RS/6000 xfail for backtrace
	through signal handler.

	* config/mt-i386-netware: Removed, separate configs for different
	  netware architectures are no longer needed now that we have

	* gdb.fortran/exprs.exp: Expect VOID instead of void.
	* gdb.fortran/types.exp: Escape the expected '*'s in Fortran

	* lib/gdb.exp (runto):  Replace sub-pattern for hex value
	by .*, since hex values have different syntax in Chill mode.

Tue Sep  6 02:15:51 1994  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* gdb.c++/demangle.exp (test_arm_style_demangling):  Remove
	linefeed from expect pattern for repeated types with indices > 9.

Mon Aug 29 14:20:44 1994  Stan Shebs  (shebs@andros.cygnus.com)

	First part of Fortran test suite.
	* gdb.fortran: New directory.
	* gdb.fortran/exprs.exp, gdb.fortran/types.exp: New files.

Sat Aug 27 23:32:43 1994  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	2417; old bug has been fixed.

Fri Aug 12 19:35:41 1994  Jeff Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.base/interrupt.exp: When trying to wake up the inferior,

	* lib/gdb.exp (gdb_test): Don't send anything if the first
	  argument is an empty string.  This makes cases where we want to
	  match output that is already in expect's buffers (for example,

	  reliably.

Tue Aug  2 10:24:08 1994  J.T. Conklin  (jtc@phishhead.cygnus.com)

	* config/netware.exp: New file.

Thu Jul 28 12:54:07 1994  J.T. Conklin  (jtc@phishhead.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t07/watchpoint.exp (test_stepping): Remove xfail for bug
	with next over a breakpoint whose condition is false.

	* gdb.t00/help.exp: Comment out "help set print" tests just like
	(and for same reason as) "help set" test.

Mon Feb 14 09:58:23 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.s (fmemLRbug_tests): New tests.
	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (fmemLRbug_tests): Run them.

Sun Feb  6 15:36:13 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t06/break.exp (test_next_with_recursion): Remove no longer
	necessary gdb_target_udi.

	* gdb.t03/ptype.exp: For UDI, skip tests which call malloc.

	* gdb.t02/whatis.exp, gdb.t03/ptype.exp: Remove xfails for PRs
	1838 and 2417; they are fixed.

	* gdb.t02/whatis.exp (v_char_array, v_signed_char_array),
	gdb.t03/ptype.exp (ptype structure, ptype union):
	Remove xfails; the test is looser than when the xfails were added.

	* gdb.t00/{help.exp,default.exp}: Don't test "target remote" on UDI.
	* gdb.t00/help.exp: Don't expect remote to be in "help target" output.

	* gdb.t01/run.exp: Only run shell test if isnative.

	* config/udi-gdb.exp (gdb_load): Use "file", not "load" command,
	since "run" automatically loads if necessary.  Call gdb_target_udi
	after the "file" since "file" kills any execution target.

	* config/udi-gdb.exp (gdb_start): Don't send "set args main" to
	GDB.  GDB doesn't work that way (not anymore at least) on UDI.
	* gdb.t01/run.exp, gdb.t06/break.exp: Don't pass extra first
	argument for UDI.

Fri Feb  4 12:19:32 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@deneb.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t17/interrupt.c: If we get EINTR, don't print an error message.

	* gdb.t17/callfuncs.exp: Add xfails for rs6000.

Sat Feb  5 09:11:56 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t24/demangle.exp: Re-write demangle to just call gdb_test,
	properly quoting regexps.  This makes the second argument to
	demangle a fixed string, which matches the callers, instead of a
	shell-style pattern which is what the previous implementation
	used.  Update some of the callers.

Sat Feb  5 10:19:09 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.s (comib_tests): Add missing instruction.
	(comib_nullified_tests): Fix typo.
	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (all comb tests): Fix thinkos in expect
	strings.  No longer expected to fail.

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.s (addib_tests): Fix typo.
	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (all addb tests): Fix thinkos in expect
	strings.  No longer expected to fail.

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (fmpy_addsub_tests): Fix typo in expect
	string.  No longer expected to fail.

Fri Feb  4 23:45:11 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (fcmp_tests): Fix thinko in expect string.
	No longer expected to fail.

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (xmpyu_tests): Fix buglet in expect
	string.  No longer expected to fail.

Fri Feb  4 10:35:42 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t24/demangle.exp: Remove a bunch more tests which differ
	only in the names (I probably got most of them).  I was even
	generous with some which differed in underscores in names, and
	probably missed a few, and I *still* was able to remove almost a
	third of the file with almost no impact on testsuite coverage.

Thu Feb  3 12:04:49 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t00/default.exp: Match udi_attach error message as well as
	the one from child_attach.

	* gdb.t00/default.exp: Use "." instead of "?" to match a question mark.

	* gdb.stabs/weird.exp: Remove xfail for const70; just fixed in GDB.

	* gdb.stabs/weird.def (bad_neg0type): Size of this type is 16, not 8.
	* gdb.stabs/weird.exp: Remove xfail for "p bad_neg0"; this fixes it.

	* Move test with enums and partial symbols back to
	gdb.t03/{ptype.exp,gdbme.c} from gdb.stabs/{weird.def,weird.exp}.
	Reverts the change of 26 May 93.  Per today's change to
	stabs.texinfo, the behavior that weird.exp was expecting was
	unreasonable; what is important is that the compiler+gdb get
	things right, which happens with a recent gcc.  Also fix the test
	to deal with native compilers which put out the stab gdb can't
	deal with.

Mon Jan 31 15:40:11 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t24/demangle.exp: Remove a bunch of tests which differ only
	in the names.  The main thing these accomplish is to slow things down.
	Many more such duplicates surely remain.

	* gdb.t00/help.exp: Comment out "help support" test just like
	(and for same reason as) "help set" test.

Mon Jan 31 06:43:45 1994  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t06/break.exp:  Remove setup_xfails for
	sparc-sun-solaris2.*, these tests now pass with latest gcc and gdb.
	* gdb.t20/inherit.exp (test_ptype_si):  Update warning message
	about known bug in gcc to include up through 2.5.8.
	* gdb.t20/inherit.exp (test_ptype_vi):  Accept "_vb." as well as
	well as "_vb$".
	* gdb.t21/cplusfuncs.exp (test_lookup_operator_functions):
	Remove setup_xfails for sparc-sun-solaris2.*, these tests now pass
	with latest gcc and gdb.
	* gdb.t22/virtfunc.exp (test_ptype_of_classes):  Accept "_vb." as
	well as "_vb$".

Sat Jan 29 23:31:26 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* configure.in (hppa*-*-*): Also configure and build stabs-only
	tests.

Thu Jan 27 08:21:16 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.t10/hppa.mt: A makefile fragment for the PA.
	* gdb.t10/configure.in (hppa*-*-*): Use it.

Tue Jan 25 12:58:26 1994  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* gdb.t09/corefile:  Increase timeout when spawning gdb explicitly.

	* gdb.t00/default.exp (show prompt): In FAIL case, only match if
	the prompt is at the start of a line.

Mon Jan 17 20:07:51 1994  Jeffrey A. Law  (law@snake.cs.utah.edu)

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.s: Add new tests for sfu and copr instructions.
	Enable "diag" instruction.  Delete copr from fpu_misc_tests, it's
	in the copr tests now.
	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp: Run new sfu and copr tests.  Do not expect
	copr in the fpu_misc tests anymore.  fpu_misc tests are no longer
	expected to fail.

Fri Jan 14 14:24:21 1994  Rob Savoye  (rob@darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t00/teststrategy.exp, gdb.t07/watchpoint.exp,

	Tweak to run under either version of expect.
	* lib/gdb.exp (default_gdb_exit): Remove "catch" statement.
	* gdb.t00/teststrategy.exp: Use isnative and verbose procedures.

	"(unsigned char *) " before the string.

	* TODO: Add notes about printing of fancy types and GDB expressions.

	* gdb.t06/configure.in: Don't try to compile signals test program
	if doing mips-idt-ecoff.	

Thu Jan 13 08:25:55 1994  Rob Savoye  (rob@darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* Most .exp files: Tweak to run under either version of expect.

Tue Jan 11 15:21:13 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t12/scope.exp: Add xfails for rs6000.  Remove 1806 from existing
	xfails; I'm not sure why they are failing, but not because of PR 1806.

Mon Jan 10 22:14:20 1994  Rob Savoye  (rob@darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* config/unix-gdb.exp: Remove gdb_unload cause it's already
	defined in lib/gdb.exp.

Fri Jan  7 12:42:45 1994  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* gdb.t07/watchpoint.exp:  Clear xfail for calling function with
	watchpoint enabled on mips, CALL_DUMMY_BREAKPOINT_OFFSET got defined.
	* gdb.t20/gdbme.cc, gdb.t21/gdbme.cc:  Conversion operator functions
	have to be typeless.

Tue Jan  4 09:32:22 1994  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* TODO: Add suggestion for copyright year test.

	so insert a tab before any assembler directive in column zero.

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp (all_fpu_memory_tests): Test FP quadword
	stores.
	* gdb.disasm/hppa.s (fpu_memory_indexing_tests): Add FP quadword
	stores.
	(fpu_short_memory_tests): Likewise.

Mon Nov 22 13:23:22 1993  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* gdb.stabs/ecoff.mt:  Delete alpha specific if block, fix typo.
	* gdb.stabs/ecoff.sed:  Escape inserted blanks with backslashes, embed
	.stabs directives in comments.

Fri Nov 19 14:09:02 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* TODO: New file, describing tests we could write.
	* gdb.t09/corefile.exp: Move description of tests to write to TODO.

Tue Nov 16 21:07:44 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t06/signals.exp: Add kludge to force re-sync.

	* gdb.t00/teststrategy.exp: If we accidently send the "maint dump-me"
	to xgdb instead of gdb, get out of gdb.

Sat Nov 13 22:50:29 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.stabs: Re-write weird.def and configuration to use sed
	instead of cpp.  sed is portable and POSIX; cpp is neither.

Fri Nov 12 15:26:36 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t06/signals.exp: Remove one sun3 XFAIL which has been fixed.

	* gdb.t03/ptype.exp: Add comments and messages about FAILs with xlc.

Wed Nov  3 13:53:34 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* lib/gdb.exp: Comment out code which depends on non-existent
	`transform' procedure.

Wed Nov  3 11:23:11 1993  Rob Savoye  (rob@darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* lib/gdb.exp (default_gdb_exit): Remove `catch "close"'.
	* lib/gdb.exp: Transform tool name.
	* gdb.t*/*.exp: Change error to perror so it works with DejaGnu
	1.1's new error handling system.

Mon Nov  1 10:36:29 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, gdb.t2*/Makefile.in: Add -O to CXXFLAGS.

Fri Oct 29 17:58:14 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t00/default.exp: Avoid tests with a lot of .* in them.
	They made pattern matching so slow that timeouts happened on
	heavily loaded systems.  Now any output from "show print" which
	gets us back to the GDB prompt is a PASS.

Mon Oct 25 14:36:50 1993  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.mt:  Use $(srcdir) in hppa.o make rule.

Mon Oct 25 13:35:29 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t06/signals.exp: Skip whole file with xfail for HPPA.

	* gdb.t24/demangle.exp: Remove "3220" from the one remaining xfail.
	It is not from PR 3220.

Sun Oct 24 18:49:58 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t00/{help.exp,default.exp}: Loosen up a few more tests which
	just started failing because they depended on the order the
	subcommands are presented, or exact docstring text.  This kind of
	test is a pain and has minimal benefit.

Thu Oct 21 08:26:48 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t09/corefile.exp: At end of test, use "core" command with
	no arguments.

Wed Oct 20 08:56:02 1993  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t{01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 15 16
	17}/Makefile.in:  Make it possible to run the testsuite with Sun
	make and CC = cross gcc by adding explicit build rules for .o
	files.

Tue Oct 19 14:57:38 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t15/funcargs.exp: Don't put comments on same line as

Mon Oct 18 21:50:08 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.disasm/hppa.exp: Use $objdir/$subdir/$binfile not just $binfile.

Fri Oct 15 15:39:54 1993  Kung Hsu  (kung@cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t20/classes.exp: 'const xxx &' becomes 'xxx const &'.

Fri Oct 15 13:45:25 1993  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	incorrect output, not just on "factorial (value=2)".

Fri Oct 15 11:52:56 1993  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* gdb.t12/scope.exp:  Remove xfails, filename::var syntax should be
	working now. Add an xfail if accesing a bss variable causes
	a memory error if the target is not yet run.

Thu Oct 14 19:16:56 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t24/demangle.exp: Clean up spacing (2 strings), inclusion of
	constructor name (2 string), name of _GLOBAL_ demangling (2 strings),
	name of __st* demangling (2 strings).  Did Kung really get the
	more than 95 others right without testing them?

Thu Oct 14 16:27:08 1993  Kung Hsu  (kung@cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t24/demangle.exp: clean up XFAILS, more than 100

Thu Oct 14 11:40:30 1993  Jeffrey Law  (law@cs.uah.edu)

	* configure.in (configdirs): Add gdb.disasm
	* gdb.disasm: New directory for GDB disassembler tests.
	* gdb.disasm/hppa.{exp,s,mt}: Disassembly tests for the HPPA.

Thu Oct 14 11:40:30 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t00/help.exp: Don't test "help set".

	* gdb.t20/inherit.exp, gdb.t22/virtfunc.exp: Remove all xfails
	from within expect statements.  None of these happen anymore and
	they cause regressions to be silently unnoticed.

	* gdb.t20/inherit.exp, gdb.t22/virtfunc.exp: Add notes (in failure
	messages) about known failures with gcc cygnus-2.4.5-930417.

	* gdb.t02/Makefile.in, gdb.t08/Makefile.in: Make all depend on
	comp-info.exp so it gets built if it doesn't exist.

	* gdb.t13/{Makefile.in,bitfields.exp}: Remove comp-info.exp stuff;
	it is no longer used.
	* gdb.t13/comp-info.c: Removed.

Wed Oct 13 22:54:06 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@deneb.cygnus.com)

Thu Oct  7 12:01:03 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t17/interrupt.exp: Add xfail for Irix (currently not really
	relevant because ^C doesn't get sent but failure can be reproduced
	interactively).

Tue Oct  5 10:43:11 1993  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* gdb.stabs/alpha.mt:  New configuration file for alpha.
	* gdb.stabs/configure.in:  Use it.
	* gdb.stabs/ecoff.mt, weird-ecoff.sed:  Change sed script to enable
	sharing with alpha.mt, redefine long to word via preprocessor.
	* gdb.stabs/weird.def:  Conditionally adapt storage layout of v_comb
	for alpha.
	* gdb.stabs/weird.exp:  Handle compilation of weird.s by alpha
	native cc.
	* gdb.t00/teststrategy.exp:  Change expect string so that we
	consume the `(xgdb)' from the command echo and from the gdb prompt.
	* gdb.t05/expr.exp:  xfail "print unsigned int == (~0)" on the alpha.
	gdb currently compares all values as long, so this failure probably
	applies to any configuration where LONGEST is bigger than a target int.
	* gdb.t08/comp-info.c:  New file to determine if gdbme is compiled
	with gcc.
	* gdb.t08/Makefile.in, opaque.exp:  Use it. Alpha native cc is unable
	to handle opaque pointers, gcc is.
	* gdb.t21/gdbme.cc, gdb.t23/gdbme.cc:  operator new takes a size_t
	as first argument. Include <sys/types.h> and change all operator
	new definitions to use size_t.
	* gdb.t21/cplusfuncs.exp:  Handle changes in output for operator new
	now that we use size_t.

Wed Sep 29 00:55:49 1993  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

        * gdb.t03/ptype.exp, gdb.t15/printcmds.exp:  When constructing
	a long or float array cast all array members to the same type.
        * gdb.t04/setvar.exp:  Handle the decimal output of an unsigned long
	with 64 bit longs.
        * gdb.t07/watchpoint.exp:  Add finish and until variations encountered
	on alpha.
        * gdb.t08/opaque.exp, gdb.t17/interrupt.exp:  Add xfails for alpha.

Tue Sep 28 17:26:47 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t24 (demangle.exp): Constructors of templates have names like
	vector<int>::vector(int) not vector<int>::vector<int>(int).  See
	section 14.6 of the ARM.

	* gdb.t24 (demangle.exp): Remove a whole bunch of tests of the form
	"_vt$MoveCmd"; these differ only in name from "_vt$foo", so they
	accomplish little and slow down the testsuite.

	* gdb.t24 (demangle.exp): Accept "XXX const" as well as "const XXX".
	Accept spaces various places.

Tue Sep 21 17:28:45 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@lioth.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t07/watchpoint.exp: On sparc, clear xfail for calling function
	with watchpoint enabled.

	* Makefile.in: Remove definition of CC and remove the second
	definition of CXX (the "CXX = gcc" one remains).  These definitions
	were causing backquotes to be expanded within backquotes, which
	doesn't work.

Sat Sep 18 09:43:21 1993  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon@poseidon.cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t17/callfuncs.exp: Add "return 0" to end.

Fri Sep 17 04:41:17 1993  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

        * gdb.stabs/ecoff.mt:  Remove STABSCC hack.
        * gdb.stabs/weird.exp:  Handle the case where weird.o is compiled
	by mips cc and contains no stabs entries.

Thu Sep 16 17:22:12 1993  Rob Savoye  (rob@darkstar.cygnus.com)

	* config/vx-gdb.exp: Use fake device to load files rather than
	NFS.
	* lib/gdb.exp: New proc to do "file" command.
	* config/unix-gdb.exp: Use new "file" proc.

Thu Sep 16 13:45:44 1993  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	restart gdb and reload the program.
	* gdb.t08/opaque.exp: Likewise.

	timeout for this test, not just for VxWorks.

Wed Feb 24 08:03:38 1993  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t31/chillvars.exp (test_structs):  New proc to test printing
	of Chill STRUCT types and STRUCT values.
	* gdb.t31/chillvars.exp (test_strings):  Expect "CHAR" now, rather
	than "char".
	* gdb.t31/in-gdbme.ch (simple_struct, nested_struct, struct1,
	struct2):  New struct definitions and initializations to test 
	simple Chill STRUCT types.

Tue Feb 23 11:55:06 1993  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* gdb.t00/teststrategy.exp:  Track reversion in gdb to not print
	the null byte at the end of strings.
	* gdb.t00/default.exp:  Make show version insensitive to copyright
	date.
	* gdb.t16/in-gdbme.c (ctable1, ctable2):  Make explicitly unsigned
	to avoid dependencies on target char signedness.
	* gdb.t16/printcmds.exp:  Update expected results for explicitly
	unsigned char.
	* gdb.t16/printcmds.exp:  Remove setup_xfails for i960 that should
	now work.
	* gdb.t21/demangle.exp:  Add many more patterns for template
	demangling, most of them being expected failures.
	* gdb.t21/demangle.exp (proc demangle):  Quote the demangled
	string we are matching for, to match on the whole string.
	* gdb.t21/demangle.exp:  Add many new test strings to demangle,
	and fix a whole bunch that had incorrect expected output but were
	passing anyway because of the bug in "proc demangle".
	* gdb.t31/chillvars.exp:  Remove setup_xfail for printing string
	type.
	* gdb.t31/in-gdbme.ch:  Uncomment string4, now compiles.

        * gdb/testsuite: made modifications to testcases, etc., to allow
        them to work properly  given the reorganization of deja-gnu and the
        relocation of the testcases from deja-gnu to a "tool" subdirectory.

Sun Feb 21 10:55:55 1993  Mike Werner  (mtw@poseidon.cygnus.com)

	* gdb/testsuite: Initial creation of gdb/testsuite.
	Migrated dejagnu testcases and support files for testing nm to
	gdb/testsuite from deja-gnu.  These files were moved "as is"
	with no modifications.  This migration is part of a major overhaul
	of dejagnu.  The modifications to these testcases, etc., which
	will allow them to work with the new version of dejagnu will be
	made in a future update.
