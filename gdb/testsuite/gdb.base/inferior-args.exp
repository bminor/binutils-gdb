# gdbserver_start via gdb_run_cmd.  Some of the weird quoting used in
# some of the tests doesn't seem to play well with gdbserver_start.
# This is a TCL issue, not a gdbserver issue.  Manually testing with
# gdbserver shows no problems.  It's just that when we try to invoke
# gdbserver from TCL the argument quoting gets messed up.  For tests
# that are problematic, STUB_SUITABLE is false.

# ` (backtick), " (double quote), \ (backslash), and newline can be
# escaped.  All other backslash characters are literal backslashes.
#
# As with the previous test, the double quotes are lost when the
# arguments are sent through gdbserver_start, as such, this test isn't
# going to work when using the native-gdbserver board, hence we set
# the second arguemnt to 'false'.
