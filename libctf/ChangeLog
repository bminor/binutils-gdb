2021-02-17  Nick Alcock  <nick.alcock@oracle.com>

	* ctf-impl.h (ctf_dict_t) <ctf_symhash>: New.
	<ctf_symhash_latest>: Likewise.
	(struct ctf_archive_internal) <ctfi_crossdict_cache>: New.
	<ctfi_symnamedicts>: New.
	<ctfi_syms>: Remove.
	(ctf_lookup_symbol_name): Remove.
	* ctf-lookup.c (ctf_lookup_symbol_name): Propagate errors from
	parent properly.  Make static.
	(ctf_lookup_symbol_idx): New, linear search for the symbol name,
	cached in the crossdict cache's ctf_symhash (if available), or
	this dict's (otherwise).
	(ctf_try_lookup_indexed): Allow the symname to be passed in.
	(ctf_lookup_by_symbol): Turn into a wrapper around...
	(ctf_lookup_by_sym_or_name): ... this, supporting name lookup too,
	using ctf_lookup_symbol_idx in non-writable dicts.  Special-case
	name lookup in dynamic dicts without reported symbols, which have
	no symtab or dynsymidx but where name lookup should still work.
	(ctf_lookup_by_symbol_name): New, another wrapper.
	* ctf-archive.c (enosym): Note that this is present in
	ctfi_symnamedicts too.

	ctf_id_t lookups: just call ctf_lookup_by_symbol as needed (but
	still cache the dicts those lookups succeed in).  Add
	lookup-by-name support, with dicts of successful lookups cached in
	ctfi_symnamedicts.  Refactor the caching code a bit.
	(ctf_arc_lookup_symbol_name): New, another wrapper.
	* ctf-open.c (ctf_dict_close): Free the ctf_symhash.
	* libctf.ver (LIBCTF_1.2): New version.  Add
	ctf_lookup_by_symbol_name, ctf_arc_lookup_symbol_name.
	* testsuite/libctf-lookup/enum-symbol.c (main): Use
	ctf_arc_lookup_symbol rather than looking up the name ourselves.
	Fish it out repeatedly, to make sure that symbol caching isn't
	broken.
	(symidx_64): Remove.
	(symidx_32): Remove.
	* testsuite/libctf-lookup/enum-symbol-obj.lk: Test symbol lookup
	in an unlinked object file (indexed symtypetab sections only).

	indexed, sorted symtypetab (and allow SYMFP to be NULL in this
