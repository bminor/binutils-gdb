Changes in 2.37:

* New features

** Add ctf_lookup_by_symbol name and ctf_arc_lookup_symbol_name, analogues of
   existing ctf_lookup_by_symbol and ctf_arc_lookup_symbol, but looking up
   symbols by name rather than symbol number.  This also works in places where no
   symbol number is known, like in object files and dynamic dicts created by
   ctf_create.

** libctf supports compilers that encode unrepresentable types via a special
   kind (CTF_K_UNKNOWN) as well as via type ID 0.

* Bugfixes

** Avoid duplicating or losing types of data object symbols when
   ld -r is used

** Prohibit typedefs with no name; prevent the linker/deduplicator
   producing such typedefs

* Bugfixes, also on 2.36 branch

** Prevent ctf_lookup_by_name returning success when
   looking up nonexistent pointer types

** Fix ctf_type_add copying of structs with unnamed members
