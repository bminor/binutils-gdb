libsframe is a support library for the GNU Binutils collection (currently used
by GNU ld, objdump, etc.) to read and write SFrame section data.

Note: This library is currently intended for internal use by GNU Binutils only.
Strict guarantees for ABI compatibility are not provided, and external projects
should not rely on the stability of these interfaces.
